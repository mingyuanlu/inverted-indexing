# Introduction
This is a project that disguises itself as a Game of Thrones related, but really is just a word-indexing task

# Approach
A streaming method was undertook. Each line in the log file is read consecutively, and the information needed is extracted on the fly. We use a dictionary to keep track of the logs.

#  Future Scaling
Kafka could be deployed for scaling up.
